C/C++
=====
1. variable and data type
 -- > (signed/unsigned)int,(signed/unsigned)long long int,
	 float, double
2. Operator and expression(statement)
	--> arithmetic, logical, bitwise, ternary operator
3. conditional statement
	--> if else, if else if .... else, switch
4. Loops (for, while, do while) , break and continue
5. Array
6. pointer
7. function (user define and library function)/Recursive function
 	- Function name, arguments/parameter, return type.
	- Flow of Function execution
	- The scope of variables, memory management(Stack memory
		Heap memory),
	- dynamic memory allocation(1d array, 2d array)
	- Call By Value & Reference
	- Recursion
	- relation between Array and pointer(pointer arithmetic)
	- string
*. Random number
*. File operation
*. Structure
*. OOP
10. procedural program to OOP
