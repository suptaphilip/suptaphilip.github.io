# "Smart Cafeteria" Adaptive And Interactive Mobile Application

## Abstract

Mobile Human-Computer Interaction is the relationship (interaction) between people and their handheld mobile systems and the applications which they use in their everyday life. In one word, mobile applications are interactive products to support users in their day to day life no matter where they are. Since technology is moving fast and changing rapidly, it is very important to understand the mobile interaction techniques and also the possible impact of mobile technologies in human life. Mobile HCI concerns about mobile applications and mobile platforms which discusses the different possible interaction techniques with those applications. The university cafeteria provides services manually to the students which causes different kind of problems such as losing time in cafeteria queue, unable to browse and choose meal in advance, not providing any kind of dieting advices to students which helps them to follow proper diet. In this thesis, I have proposed an adaptive and interactive mobile application called “Smart Cafeteria” which will provide services to the university students and faculty members to manage their meal in the university cafeterias which in consequence makes their life more easy and comfortable. I have followed HCI interaction design methodology in every step such as problem define, data gathering, requirement analysis, prototype development and usability evaluation for “Smart Cafeteria” application.
